        <h2>What you see before you is art made by me.</h2>
        <p><span id="specificStyle">I have never really considered myself to be much of an artist. But when I took a drawing class last semester I got really into drawing and wanting to improve my skills.</span>
            <br />
        <span id="specificStyle">All the hand drawn art is either from my personal sketchbook in 4B graphite pencil or a large canvas charcoal drawing.</span>
        <br />
        <span id="specificStyle">The two digital art pieces are some of my most recent works. I made both of these pieces for my photoshop class 
        that I am taking this semester.</span>
